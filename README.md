# SPMS2D

These are my project files that are being created as I work through the Weekend Code Project: Unity's New 2D Workflow tutorials by Jesse Freeman (http://jessefreeman.com/books/unity-2d-workflow/).

The biggest changes I've made have been to get these files working in Unity 5.0, where the code at the site above is for Unity 4.3. That being said, this is the very first Unity project I've worked on, so my solutions to get this working may not be the correct and/or best way to do it.

Sprites for the game are from:
